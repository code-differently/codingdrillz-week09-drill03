Coding Challenge

You have 30 mins to get as far in this challenge as possible. This is not about finishing, its about taking the correct steps to get to the end.

### Steps:

1. Comments, make sure you comment out every step you want to take, make a plan.
2. Start coding

### Problem

Given a word, check each letter in that word to see if its a vowel `[a,e,i,o,u]`. If there is a vowel return true, if there isn't a vowel return false.

#### Example 01

```
String input = "abc";
Boolean expected = true;
```

Because input contains the letter `a` , the return value should be `true`.

#### Example 02

```
String input = "xyz";
Boolean expected = false;
```
